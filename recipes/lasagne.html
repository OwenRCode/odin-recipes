    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagne is one of the most filling and cheesy meals you will ever eat. It is a must try!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 diced onion, 1 carrot, 1 celery stalk, 2 garlic cloves, 250g mince beef, 250g pork mince, 1 tablespoon tomato puree, 400g tin chopped tomatos, 200ml beef stock, 200ml red wine, 50g parmesan, 150g mozzarella</p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season. Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens. Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately. </p>
